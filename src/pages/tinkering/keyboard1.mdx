# Hand-Wired Custom Keybaord

As a software developer, I interact with my work almost entirely through my keyboard.
Painters use their own brushes and chefs prefer their own knives, so I wanted to build my
own keyboard. I am not the first to have the idea to build a keyboard from scratch. I had
been lurking in the mechanical keyboard community for a while and was familiar with the
general idea and processes. I relied on that acquired knowledge and existing resources from
the community. I did not spend very much time in the planning phase, so I decided to call
the keyboard the "wing it" keyboard. So far, building my own keyboard is the
biggest "tinkering" project I have ever attempted.


This project combined several disciplines - electrical engineering, 2D and 3D CAD,
industrial design, and software development. These skills are split between the hardware and
software parts of the project.

## Hardware

For my first keyboard, I decided to use a hand-wired approach to connect the components, as
opposed to using a printed circuit boad (PCB). In addition to the easier learning curve and
lower cost, the hand-wired approach allowed me to start with the physical design. The first
step was finding a layout that I liked.

### CAD & Prototyping

<CaptionedImage src="/images/tinkering/keyboard1/cad1.png" caption="LibreCAD Layout" />
      
I used a 2D CAD program called LibreCAD to lay out the key switches and other components
like the microcontroller and LCD screen. I then printed the CAD file at 1:1 scale, pasted it
onto some foamboard, and cut out holes for the key switches to get a sense of how the design
felt.

Naturally I didn't get it perfect on the first attempt. Revisions include changing the
vertical staggering on the inner-most column, changing the thumb cluster from one column of
3 keys to a 2x2 grid, and rearranging the other components. In total, it only took 3 tries
before I settled on a layout that I found comfortable.

### Assembly
  
Parts were easy to order because I had already created the vector files required for laser
cutting during the design phase.

I chose a 5 layer design for the case. I liked the idea of wood grain on a keyboard but
the laser cutting service I used did not offer wooden materials thick enough to provide
enough structure. I had to combine a wooden veneer with an acrylic sheet to form a top
plate with enough rigidity. I also chose a clear acrylic for the bottom layer so I could
see the wires from below.

├─────────────────┤
│                 │  # 3mm acrylic bottom plate
└─────────────────┘
```
</Grid>
 
The only finishing step I did was apply a few coats of sealant to the bamboo veneer layer.
The last step before adding the key switches was securing the thumbstick and buttons to the
acrylic top layer with epoxy.

</SimpleGrid>

The rotary encoders turned out to be a big pain. Firstly, the holes in the top plate were
designed to fit the shaft. It turned out that the shaft of the encoder was not long enough
to go through both the acrylic and bamboo top plates. I ended up using a set of files to
expand the holes in the acrylic top plate to fit the rectangular footprint of the encoder.

Next, the encoders had a little nub that I think is intended to help align the part in an
industrial assembly process, but the nub prevented the encoders from sitting flush against a
top plate. That had to be removed with my flush cutters.


With all components in place, I could plan out how to connect everything. Note that the
wiring guide says that current goes into columns and comes out of rows, but that was just a
helpful way for me to think about it. I'll explain in more detail in the
[switch matrix](#switch-matrix) section below.

The plans hide some of the connections from the Teensy to the rows and columns but you can
see them marked with colorful dots.

## Software

Most people crafting their own keyboards use an open-source tool called
[QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). QMK supports many different
microcontrollers, including the Teensy 2.0, so I assumed my Teensy 3.6 would work as well. I
did not realize the Teensy 2.0 and 3.6 use different architectures (AVR on the 2.0 vs ARM on
the 3.6). This would not have been a problem if I didn't need analog signal
capabilities for the thumbstick.


I estimated it would be easier to write my own keyboard firmware using the built-in arduino
libraries than port the digital read code to work with QMK. So I wrote my own keyboard
firmware.


There are 4 main capabilities of the keyboard that needed programming. The switch matrix,
the display, the encoders, and the thumbstick. The firmware works by polling each
row/column, the rotary encoders, and the analog thumbstick. At the end of each polling
cycle, the appropriate key/mouse signals are sent over USB and the LCD display gets updated.
      

### Switch Matrix

The most important feature of the keyboard is the switch matrix. The switches are arranged
in a matrix of rows and columns to make efficient use of I/O pins on the microcontroller.

<Grid templateColumns="1fr auto" columnGap={4}>
    <div>
    The matrix works by "turning on" one row at a time and checking the state of
    each column along the row. You can see the matrix in the wiring guide I used. There are a
    lot of other nuances to consider in the implementation, but this is a good mental model.

    />
</Grid>

### Display

The display was not very difficult to get working. The hardware was sourced from Adafruit
who also published an arduino library for the display on github. The only trick was to run
the display code on a different thread from the other components because the redraw routine
was significantly slowing down the polling cycle, causing missed keystrokes.


### Encoders & Gray Code

Most rotary encoders use [gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code) to communicate when,
and in which direction, they have been rotated. Gray code is an ordered sequence of codes
(usually represented as binary) where each code differs from its immediate neighbors by only
1 bit.


StackExchange user Spehro Pefhany wrote a great explanation of
[why gray code is better than binary](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/464420).
Essentially, due to mechanical imperfections it is nearly impossible to change multiple
bits at the same time. If the encoder used binary, the logic system may not be able to
accommodate the "in-between" states when multiple bits are changing. Gray code is
preferable because only one bit changes between each state, so no need to worry about
different bits changing at different times.


Gray code is awesome because it is inherently robust. The disadvantage is that programming a
micro-controller (MCU), or reading code that other people have written, to interpret gray
code is way more work than it ought to be. Mostly this is due to the tendency for
programmers of embedded systems to prefer speed over readability. Gray code is common enough
that there is a standard function that most people just copy/paste. Here it is:


```cpp
void encoder_read(void) {
  for (int i = 0; i < NUMBER_OF_ENCODERS; i++) {
      encoder_state[i] <<= 2;
      encoder_state[i] |= (readPin(encoders_pad_a[i]) << 0) | (readPin(encoders_pad_b[i]) << 1);
      encoder_value[i] += encoder_LUT[encoder_state[i] & 0xF];
      if (encoder_value[i] >= ENCODER_RESOLUTION) {
          // direction is arbitrary here, but this is counter-clockwise on my encoder
          encoder_update_kb(i, COUNTRECLOCKWISE);
      }
      if (encoder_value[i] <= -ENCODER_RESOLUTION) {
          // direction is arbitrary here, but this is clockwise on my encoder
          encoder_update_kb(i, CLOCKWISE);
      }
      encoder_value[i] %= ENCODER_RESOLUTION;
  }
}
```

Gross. But I had to write the firmware from scratch and I wanted to really understand how
the code works, so I had the pleasure of trying to figure out what was going on. I ended up
doing some light refactoring, but at the end of the day, this code needs to be as fast as
possible, so after the refactoring I mostly reverted the code back to the more performant
but less readable state. Here is what I started wtih:

```cpp
void scan_encoders(){
  for(int i = 0; i < NUMBER_OF_ENCODERS; i++){
      //Prev state is still in the left-most 2 bits. Move it over 2 to make room for the next state
      last_encoder_states[i] <<= 2;

      //Read pin A and B into the 2 left-most bits where B is in the left-most bit and A is in the second-to-left-most bit
      last_encoder_states[i] |= ((read_pin(encoders_pin_a[i]) << 0) | (read_pin(encoders_pin_b[i]) << 1));

      //look up value using state table
      encoder_values[i] += enc_states[last_encoder_states[i] & 0xf];

      if(encoder_values[i] >= ENCODER_RESOLUTION){
          on_encoder(i, true);    //Encoder rotated clockwise
      }
      else if(encoder_values[i] <= -ENCODER_RESOLUTION){
          on_encoder(i, false);   //Encoder rotated counter-clockwise
      }

      encoder_values[i] %= ENCODER_RESOLUTION;
  }
}
```

The first step to understanding this is to grasp how the states work. Each encoder has two
pads (or pins, depending on how you think about the circuit), so the state can be stored as
2 bits (AB). However, we want to know when the state changes, so we need to keep track of
the previous state. We're up to 4 bits total (ABAB). The first two bits are the
previous state, and the final two are the current state. Now the first line makes sense:

```cpp
//Prev state is still in the left-most 2 bits.
//Move it over 2 to make room for the next state
last_encoder_states[i] <<= 2;
```

The real work in this function is done on this line:

```cpp
//look up value using state table
encoder_values[i] += enc_states[last_encoder_states[i] & 0xf];
```

"enc_states" is a lookup table that translates the gray code into a clockwise (1),
counter-clockwise (-1), or no-change (0) value. The lookup table is constructed using a few
rules:

> **Rule 1:** The encoder must have been rotated counter-clockwise if...
>
>    a. A has changed and it is equal to B, or
>
>    b. B has changed and it is opposite of A 
> 
>
> **Rule 2:** The encoder must have been rotated clockwise if...
>
>    a. A has changed and it is opposite of B, or
>
>    b. B has changed and it is equal to A

These rules may be more obvious next to diagrams of A and B while the encoder is rotating.
Remember that the encoders were designed with these rules as part of the specification.

On to building the lookup table. Each index is a 4-bit integer and can be split into a
previous state and current state (recall the ABAB encoding from before). Then all we have to
do is figure out which pads changed from the previous state to the current, and using our
rules we can determine if the change was a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation.
Here's the full table, annotated with what changed and which rule applies:


| PREV. AB | CUR. AB | INDEX       | ENC STATES | DESCRIPTION                     |             |
|:--------:|:-------:|------------:|-----------:|:--------------------------------|:------------|
| LL	   | LL      |   0 (00 00) |          0 | (no change from old state)      | |
| LL	   | LH      |   1 (00 01) |         -1 | B changes to opposite of A      | Rule 1.b (CCW) |
| LL	   | HL      |   2 (00 10) |          1 | A changes to opposite of B      | Rule 2.a (CW) |
| LL	   | HH      |   3 (00 11) |          0 | (Both change, cannot determine) | Invalid gray code |
| LH	   | LL      |   4 (01 00) |          1 | B changes to equal A            | Rule 2.b (CW) |
| LH	   | LH      |   5 (01 01) |          0 | (no change from old state)	  | |
| LH	   | HL      |   6 (01 10) |          0 | (Both change, cannot determine) | Invalid gray code |
| LH	   | HH      |   7 (01 11) |         -1 | A changes to equal B            | Rule 1.a (CCW) |
| HL	   | LL      |   8 (10 00) |         -1 | A changes to equal B            | Rule 1.a (CCW) |
| HL	   | LH      |   9 (10 01) |          0 | (Both change, cannot determine) | Invalid gray code |
| HL	   | HL      |  10 (10 10) |          0 | (no change from old state)      | |
| HL	   | HH      |  11 (10 11) |          1 | B changes to equal A            | Rule 2.b (CW) |
| HH	   | LL      |  12 (11 00) |          0 | (Both change, cannot determine) | Invalid gray code |
| HH	   | LH      |  13 (11 01) |          1 | A changes to opposite of B      | Rule 2.a (CW) |
| HH	   | HL      |  14 (11 10) |         -1 | B changes to opposite of A      | Rule 1.b (CCW) |
| HH	   | HH      |  15 (11 11) |          0 | (no change from old state)      | |


So after all of that, the rest is easy. We now know the direction of rotation, so we can
call some other function accordingly.


```cpp
//look up value using state table
encoder_values[i] += enc_states[last_encoder_states[i] & 0xf];

if(encoder_values[i] >= ENCODER_RESOLUTION){
  on_encoder(i, true);    //Encoder rotated clockwise
}
else if(encoder_values[i] <= -ENCODER_RESOLUTION){
  on_encoder(i, false);   //Encoder rotated counter-clockwise
}

encoder_values[i] %= ENCODER_RESOLUTION;
```

The `ENCODER_RESOLUTION` is used to slow down and "smooth" the result. It is
typically set to 2 or 4. The idea is that the encoder is so sensitive that if we read one
clockwise rotation it is difficult to determine if the user really did rotate the encoder or
if something just nudged it enough to change states. The solution is to only register a
rotation when the encoder is far enough away from the last registered rotation. In other
words, if the encoder rotates once it might be a fluke but four times in the same direction
is most likely intentional.


## Final Result

<CaptionedImage src="/images/tinkering/keyboard1/ItsAlive.jpg" caption="It's Alive!" />

After hardware assembly and flashing the firmware, all that was left was putting on some
keycaps. I was amazed how smoothly everything worked out. I learned a lot of skills and
acquired a lot of tools that will expand my capabilities for future projects.


The end result is a neat little keyboard that feels like it will fall apart if you look at
it too long. There will definitely be a 2nd generation of custom keyboards in the future.


#### Update 2 years later

After a few months, one solder connection failed but was easily fixed. This keyboard is
still used nearly every day.
