# Custom Keyboard Mk.II
## Improving on the Original


The original `Wing_it!` was a surprising success, but there is always room for
improvement. Using the Mk. I as my daily driver quickly brought to light the deficiencies of
my original design and got me thinking of an even better keyboard.


### Keeping the Good

There were two main features that I wanted to keep from the design of my original keyboard.

- Comfortable key layout
- Vertical scroll wheel

#### Layout

The general layout of the original `Wing_it!` fit my hands well. This wasn't
a big surprise considering the amount of time I spent prototyping and refining the layout.
To reduce the number of things that could go wrong, I decided to re-use my original CAD
drawings so the Mk. II fits in the exact same footprint as the Mk. I.


#### Vertical Scrolling

The rotary encoder used for vertical scrolling in the original `Wing_it!` was
effective and helpful. Plans for the Mk. II included a rotary encoder in an optional module.


### Improving the Bad

#### Firmware

I made the decision to write my own custom firmware for the original `Wing_it!` keyboard.
It worked well enough but updating it was time consuming, and the typing experience was not
perfectly consistent.


The next iteration needed to target [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware),
an open-source keyboard firmware. QMK would provide more stability and allow me to both
configure the keyboard and develop new features more easily.


#### Horizontal Scrolling

The 2nd rotary encoder used for horizontal scrolling had one fatal flaw. Very few
applications actually support horizontal scrolling. The dedicated horizontal scroll wheel
was awesome when it worked, but I did not think it was worth keeping for Mk. II.


#### Analog Thumbstick Mouse Controller

The thumbstick in the middle of the original `Wing_it!` design was one of those
"because I can" features. There were three main issues, all hardware limitations.


First, the thumbstick components I received are not precision devices. Releasing the stick
would cause it to spring back to center, but the area that the stick could eventually settle
in (called the "dead zone") was too big. I ended up having to set the dead zone to
cover 50% of both the X and Y axis.


The second issue was exacerbated by the first. The analog-to-digital converters (ADC) I used
were built into the microcontroller and were not precise enough to make up for the large
dead zone.


Finally, the thumbstick is difficult to move precisely. The stick has high "stiction" - it
takes a lot of force to get moving - so by the time it's moving you have already pushed
it against the edge of its restraining outer ring. It is also difficult to move the
thumbstick at any angle off of the X/Y axes unless the stick is riding against that outer
ring.


The end result was that the thumbstick acted more like an 8-direction D-pad, nullifying the
utility of the thumbstick. I did not giving up on the idea of controlling the mouse, but I
did give up on that particular component, and the ADC embedded in the microcontroller.


#### LCD Screen

The LCD Screen actually worked really well. I did not end up using it to its fullest
potential and it became a glorified num/caps lock indicator. So I decided the Mk. II would
not feature a display. Instead a few discrete LEDs would indicate the caps lock and num lock
states.


### New Features

Refining a successful design is nice but I enjoy inventing even more. There was a long list
of new features I considered but here is what I settled on:

- Wireless/Bluetooth connectivity
- USB type-C
- Capability for expansion module(s)
- Not hand-wired

## Hardware Design

The new requirement of "not hand-wired" meant that I would need to design a custom printed
circuit board (PCB). Learning how to design PCBs became the primary skill I acquired during
the project. I chose to reuse the form-factor of the original, including the footprint and layout
to reduce the complexity of the project.


The new design removed some components like rotary encoders, the analog thumbstick and LCD display.
Removing those components made room for new components like a battery, bluetooth adapters and
other components that would replace the microcontroller from the old design.


A new trend of using through-hole components had developed since I worked on the original
`wing_it`. I liked the idea of being able to see all of the components that made
the keyboard work, so I used a "skeleton" design for the top plate which would put the
electronics on display. The skeleton design meant there would be less material to support
the keys and the thin acrylic sheet from the Mk I. may not have been strong enough. That
constraint drove the decision to build the Mk II. out of stainless steel, which has recently
become more affordable to laser cut.

    The plan for Mk II. was another 5 layer stackup:

```
  Layer Stackup
┌─────────────────┐  # 1.2mm stainless steel top plate
├─────────────────┤ 
│                 │  # 3.8mm spacer
├─────────────────┤  # 1.6mm PCB
├─────────────────┤
│                 │  # 3.8mm spacer
├─────────────────┤
└─────────────────┘  # 1.2mm stainless steel bottom plate
```

</Grid>


The last piece was a clear 0.5mm then acrylic sheet that would cover the otherwise exposed
pcb from accidental damage.


## PCB Design

A "not hand-wired" custom layout keyboard requires designing a custom PCB. Luckily there is an
excellent [guide written by github user Ruiqi Mao](https://github.com/ruiqimao/keyboard-pcb-guide).
After following the guide it was relatively simple to expand the simple example to the layout I had in mind.


The decision to keep the electronic components visible also came with the added constraint
of where I could place the components. That constraint meant I had to design the PCB
backwards. Typically the schematic drives component placement which drives the size and
shape of the PCB, but I started with a size and shape and had to figure out how to cram all
of my components into that space. It turned into an exercise of breaking the entire keyboard
into groups of components for each system, placing each group in a general area, then
refining the layout to fit inside the footprint I had alloted myself.


## Outcome

The outcome was a dissappointing paperweight made of steel and electrical components. Here's what went wrong:

#### PCB Schematic Design Issues

Each main system of the schematic had at least 1 issue.

##### Battery Management System Issues

The Battery Management System (BMS) actually worked well. I attribute this to the open-hardware design
that I used. The issue was related to the part of the BMS that I designed - the BMS could not power other components.
I haven't done enough investigation to figure out why yet.

##### Microcontroller Issues

The microcontroller unit (MCU) technically worked. However, the bootloader in the MCU was easy to overwrite with
a small bug in software. If the firmware wrote to the wrong address in memory (and my firmware definitely did),
the MCU would refuse to boot, essentially disabling the entire PCB.

##### Key Switch Matrix Issues

To reduce the number of I/O pins required from the MCU I decided to use a multiplexer and demultiplexer design for
polling the switch matrix. To select a row, I used a 1:8 demultiplexer and to read the columns on the row I used an 8:3 multiplexer.
What I failed to consider was the effect of "floating" pins on the multiplexing side.

Unlike the discrete on/off states in software, the hardware input pins exist in a continuous spectrum between "high" and "low" voltage.
In-between the high and low voltages, the pins are said to be "floating". The floating state is essentially an unknown voltage -
it's *floating* between high (+5V) and low (0V, ground). This is why electrical engineers use "pull-up" and "pull-down" resistors.
The purpose is to pull the floating lines up to 5V or down to ground.

In conventional switch matrices, the rows and columns are connected directly so pull-up resistors are only required on the column pins.
The demultiplexer and multiplexers in my design acted as a disconnection point. Although I had pull-up resistors on the column pins, I
failed to realize that pull-up resistors were also needed on the row pins. The switch matrix failed because of that mistake.

#### Component Choice Issues

Before assembling the PCBs I had to think about the order of assembly. Some of the components
were quite expensive or had footprints that made hand-soldering difficult. I tried to solder
the difficult components before the expensive components, but there were so many opportunities
for mistakes that 3 of my 5 boards were scrapped. The PCBs were not cheap, and it is difficult
to remove components without a hot air gun, so scrapping an entire board and the expensive
components that were stuck to it was a painful experience.

#### Hardware Fit Issues

The space between the top plate and PCB must be a very specific dimension because of the
size of the key switches. It was difficult to find spacers of that exact height. The USB
and TRRS receptacles were also too tall and ended up bending the top plate and PCB a little
bit. It was only noticable when looking for it, but could have been avoided with more testing
and a little bit of forethought.

#### Planning Issues

I chose not to test any part of the design before I ordered the pcb, laser cut parts
and electrical components. In hind sight it seems obvious that nothing would work on the
first attempt, and it even seemed obvious when I ordered everything at the same time. So
when nothing worked I was left with a very expensive paperweight.


## Lessons Learned

#### Big PCBs are expensive

Unless your aesthetic is "one giant PCB" it makes much more sense to break different subsystems into separate boards.

This lesson is analogous to the monolithic vs microservice architecture decision. Physically splitting subsystems
into their own boards will be significantly cheaper because many small boards is cheaper than one huge one. It will
also let me more accurately track changes for each system, simplify the overall design, and most importantly allow me to upgrade one system
without scrapping an entire PCB that was otherwise working perfectly.


#### Test as you go

As a software developer I am used to writing a lot of code without testing it, then investigating the issue when it inevitably fails.
This is possible because it costs nothing to run a bit of code on my laptop. But physical things cost money.

In future projects I will need to design and test each part of my project on breadboards first. I will probably even design small,
isolated prototype PCBs before committing to a final design.

#### MFG one thing at a time

Similar to testing as I go, it is important to make sure the independent parts are correctly manufactured before ordering their dependent parts.


#### Decouple Where Possible

Another software practice that translates to other practices. If two components don't need to be related, then don't relate them.
Keep components as independent as possible.

It is difficult to find spacers of the exact height required to fit between the pcb and top plate, so I should not have designed
the PCB to be part of the outer case.
